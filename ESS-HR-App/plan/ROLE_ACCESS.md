# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

> Mirrors Odoo HR module permissions exactly.
> The user's `role` is returned by `POST /auth/login` and stored in Redux auth state.

---

## Roles

| Role | Odoo Equivalent | Data Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `employee` | `base.group_user` — Internal User | Own records only |
| `manager` | `hr.group_hr_user` + set as leave/expense approver | Own + direct/indirect subordinates (parent_id chain) |
| `hr` | `hr.group_hr_manager` — HR Officer | All employees |
| `admin` | `base.group_system` + HR Administrator | All records, no restrictions |

---

## Data Scope Rules

| Scope | API Filter Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `own` | filter by `employee_id == me` |
| `subordinates` | `employee_id == me` OR employee is in manager's subordinate chain |
| `all` | no employee filter — full company dataset |

---

## Module Permissions

## How to Test

### Test Accounts

Create four employee accounts in Odoo, each assigned a distinct role. Use their badge IDs and PINs on the Login screen to test each role:

| Role | Suggested Badge ID | Odoo Group |
|---|---|---|
| `employee` | `EMP-TEST` | Internal User only |
| `manager` | `MGR-TEST` | HR User + set as leave/attendance approver |
| `hr` | `HR-TEST` | HR Officer (`hr.group_hr_manager`) |
| `admin` | `ADM-TEST` | HR Administrator + System |

### Login

Use the standard Login screen — enter the employee's badge ID and PIN, or username and password. Select the correct company on the Company Selection screen before logging in.

### What to Verify Per Role

#### Employee (`EMP-0099`)
- Home services grid shows **no** My Team or Pending Approvals tiles
- More Hub shows **no** Analytics or Team Hours items
- Navigating directly to Pending Approvals, Team Balance, Analytics, or Team Hours shows the **🔒 Access Denied** screen
- Leave detail screen shows **no** Approve / Refuse buttons
- Profile subtitle shows `· Employee`

#### Manager (`EMP-0042`)
- Home grid shows **My Team** and **Pending Approvals** tiles
- More Hub shows **Team Hours**; **Analytics** is visible
- Pending Approvals screen loads with Leave, Expense, Loan, Advance Salary, Business Service tabs
- Leave detail screen shows **Approve** and **Refuse** buttons on pending requests
- Analytics screen loads with `subordinates` scope data
- Profile subtitle shows `· Manager`

#### HR (`HR-0001`)
- All manager screens accessible
- Pending Approvals includes HR Letters, Document Requests, Experience Certificates actions
- Leave detail shows both first and second-level approval actions
- Analytics loads with `all` scope (company-wide data)
- Profile subtitle shows `· Hr`

#### Admin (`ADM-001`)
- Full access to everything
- Pending Approvals shows all approval types including CEO-level Loan
- Analytics and Team Hours load with `all` scope
- Profile subtitle shows `· Admin`

### Testing Approval Flows

1. Log in as **Employee** → create a leave request → status becomes `pending`
2. Log out → log in as **Manager** → open Pending Approvals → approve the request
3. Log out → log in as **HR** → open Pending Approvals → validate (second-level) the request
4. Log back in as **Employee** → confirm leave status is now `approved`

| `app/src/hooks/useRBAC.ts` | Hook consumed by screens to read permissions |
